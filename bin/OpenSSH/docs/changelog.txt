Changelog for OpenSSH for Windows

31 December 2011 (Mike Dixson - http://mikedixson.com)
- Updated all binaries to current releases
- Added several new supporting DLLs as required by all executables in package
- Renamed switch.exe to bash.exe to remove the need to modify and compile mkpasswd.exe each build
- Added modified xcacls.vbs script (original downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=19419 ) (modification allows Windows 7 to use the script)
- Known Bug: When connecting via SSH to use the terminal the following warning:
	cygwin warning:
	  MS-DOS style path detected: C:/Windows/system32/cmd.exe
	  Preferred POSIX equivalent is: /cygdrive/c/Windows/system32/cmd.exe
	  CYGWIN environment variable option "nodosfilewarning" turns off this warning.
	  Consult the user's guide for more details about POSIX paths:
	    http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using.html#using-pathnames
	This warning can be safely ignored. It's to do with the way switch.exe (now bash.exe) was originally coded. I'm working on recoding this but I'm not a C coder so it's a bit of a headache for me. Any help would be appreciated.

25 January 2006 (Mike Dixson - http://mikedixson.com)
 - Updated all binaries to current releases
 - Added cygintl-2.dll and cygintl-3.dll as required by some exe's such as ls.exe
 - Altered CYGWIN Environment variable FROM "binmode ntsec tty"  TO  "binmode nontsec tty" to fix permissions issue that occurred when using SFTP or SCP.
 - Updated mkpasswd.exe from latest source (modified source included)
 - Added documentation for using WinSCP with OpenSSH for Windows

15 October 2003
 - Removed chmod in installer - permissions were not working correctly
 - Moved back to cacls - see above

30 September 2003
 - Fixed bugs in installer
 - Added chmod for install support


22 September 2003
 - Updated to Cygwin1.dll v1.5.4
 - Moved to OpenSSH 3.7.1p1-1 because of security issues found in older versions

 KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Due to the quick need for this, and changes in NSIS, the installer has cosmetic issues
 - Some users have reported issues with Windows XP. I have tested this release
   with a default install with SP1 and have not had issues. I have not been able
   to test all configurations.
 - Using the included server with key-based authentication may not work unless
   you set StrictModes to off. It seems to be an issue with Windows file permissions.
   I am not considering this problem as a bug, but a solution is being investigated.
