Using WinSCP with OpenSSH for Windows
=====================================
Mike Dixson (http://sshwindows.webheat.co.uk)

WinSCP is a useful graphical user interface for transferring files over an encrypter connection
using SCP or SFTP. It can be found at: http://winscp.net
SFTP and SCP are natively more secure than standard FTP.


To set up a saved session in WinSCP to connect to OpenSSH for Windows:
1/. Open WinSCP
	a/. Click on NEW on the right hand side
	b/. In the Host name box enter the IP address (change the port number if you've set up OpenSSH to run on a different port number).
	c/. Enter a username (it's up to you whether you wish to save a password with the saved session but it is inadvisable).
	d/. Click the SCP radio button below

2/. Check the Advances Options box
	a/. Expand the Environment setting
	b/. Click on SCP
	c/. Under Shell click the Enter radio button and from the drop down to the right of it choose /bin/sh
	d/. Under Other options uncheck the following(this will speed up connection times):
		*Lookup user groups
		*Clear aliases
		*Clear national variables

3/. Click Save and either accept the default name for the saved session or rename as appropriate.


When you connect the first time you will receive a notification about the server's SSH key, accept this to connect.
You will also see a 'banner' message, you can choose to not see this again or to just ok it for this time.
The text in this banner is the standard one that comes with opensshd, it can be changed if required, it just gives a fairly standard warning about breaking security being liable to prosecution etc.
